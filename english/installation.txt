1. Move "csgo_colormod" to this folder: Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource
2. Add -language colormod in CS:GO launch options
3. Restart CS:GO & enjoy

Not working?
1. Make sure that csgo_colormod is placed in the right folder (it needs to be inside the "resource" folder)
2. Check your launch options for spelling mistakes, this example will work: -novid -language colormod -tickrate 128
